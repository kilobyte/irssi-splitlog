Here's a script to split irssi logs into per-day pieces.

Use this if you set a scheme such as:
   autolog_path = "~/irclogs/$tag/$0.%Y-%m-%d.log";
only after years of using irssi, and have log files of unmanageable size.
For example, ##crawl between Jan 2010 and Sep 2012 is 750MB big.

If a partial day has an existing per-day log, this script _appends_ to it
(you might want to use "mc" and move the files over, to append over existing
in the right order).  Also, it's not idempotent and running it twice will
double the logs, beware!

A day that has nothing but joins and leaves is preserved in a channel log
(one that starts with a #) but not in a personal log -- like new versions
of irssi do.
